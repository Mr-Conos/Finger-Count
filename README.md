# 🖐 Finger-Count

Count how many fingers you are holding up using AI *(For a bigger project)*

### How To Use

Download and run the file `FingerCount.py`. From there, put your right hand up to the camera and the AI will display how many fingers you are holding. 

### Credits

I followed a tutorial and made a few modifications to it's code.
